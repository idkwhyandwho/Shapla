The Shapla Foundation aims to achieve at least 1,500 family reunifications and support small-scale family projects in Bangladesh.
To achieve this, we collaborate with various partner organizations that share our vision of supporting children.
Want to help a child? Then help their parents.
This way, we ensure that children stay in touch with their parents and reunite those who have lost touch, defend their rights, and strengthen their positions through counseling and support projects.
